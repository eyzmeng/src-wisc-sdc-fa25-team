hacker
   A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
   internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
   particular.  The term is often misused in a pejorative context,
   where "cracker" would be the correct term.  See also: cracker.

Welcome to the team!!!

I am not your leader today, but I hope y'all are still with me...

   * Add your changes in CHANGES.  (Copy the example.)
   * If you contribute, your name goes into AUTHORS
     and you get a virtual Cookie! :P

   ***--> Once we decide on a project, put the specs in here,
          and create an INSTALL file (with NO file extension)
          for detailed installation/deployment process.

       [[ If the Club permits and everyone is fine with it, we
          may even release it as FOSS! ]]

Remember to WRAP your lines at column 72/76/80 so that the text

*** Setup

The SvelteKit frontend is in web/ and the Flask backend is in api/.

***--> Node.js 22.x

Install Node.js 22.x by either installing from here:
<https://nodejs.org/en/download> (probably the most straightforward
way to install Node.js if you are Windows), or by using a Node
version manager such as <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm> and
<https://github.com/tj/n>.
(This is required for the Svelte-Vercel adapter plugin to work...)

***--> Running backend

Run

    corepack enable pnpm

You should now have the pnpm binary?  (If not, you may have to
restart your terminal for it to find the right path.  In Bash,
you can run "hash -r"; and in zsh, you can run "rehash".)

    cd web
    pnpm install

To test if it worked:

    pnpm run dev

and go to <http://localhost:5173/>.

***--> Python 3.12+

You should know how to do this.

***--> Poetry 2+

You can install Poetry as a standalone program from a package manager
of your choice; or use the official installer; or install with Pip.
There are many options; pick one and go with it....
(See also <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>)

>!! NOTE!!!  <<<<<<@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<<<<

>!! Note that if you have Poetry 1.x the following steps WILL FAIL.  See issue:
>!! <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/10029#issuecomment-2588728302>
>!! You should check your Poetry version by running `poetry --version'.  You may
>!! be surprised that you are not running the version you thought you were using.
>!!
>!! YOU HAVE TO USE POETRY 2.0.0 OR NEWER.  IT WILL NOT WORK ON, SAY, 1.8.3.
>!!
>!! If all else fails, just use `pip install -r lib/requirements.txt'.  It's not
>!! ideal, but it gets the job done if you don't need to declare new dependencies.

***--> Running backend

After you (somehow) install Poetry, you activate an environment first:

    cd api
    poetry install

  #######################################################################
  # (SKIP THIS PART UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!!)
  ##### OR.... (if you prefer to do it yourself)
  #
  # python3 -m venv <path>
  # . <path>/bin/activate            # on Unix (macOS, Linux, BSD, etc.)
  # <path>\Scripts\Activate.bat  & REM Windows (Command Prompt or cmd.exe)
  # <path>\Scripts\Activate.ps1      # Windows (PowerShell)
  #
  # # Tell poetry to use the virtual environment we are using; see
  # # <https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#local-configuration>
  # poetry config virtualenvs.create false --local
  # # Then install dependencies:
  # poetry install
  #######################################################################

Now you can finally run the backend:

    poetry run python -m app

This runs it on port 8000.  Though you may choose a different port:

    poetry run python -m app 8080

To get the full command usage, pass -h:

    $ poetry run python -m app -h
    usage: __main__.py [-h] [-d] [-b BIND] [--cors] [port]

    positional arguments:
      port        listening port (default: 8000)

    options:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      -d          enable debug (default: False)
      -b BIND     bind address (default: 127.0.0.1)
      --cors      allow Cross-Origina Requests (default: False)

***--> Running frontend AND backend

CORS is nasty.  You have two option:

    Option 1:  Reverse proxy from Vite to backend.

        In one terminal:         |          In another terminal:
     ----------------------------+-----------------------------------------
        pnpm run dev             |          poetry run python -m app

    This lets you run the web site as if <http://localhost:5173/>
    served both the frontend and the backend.  WORKING THIS WAY IS
    ENCOURAGED.  Frontend people: If you choose not to do it this
    way (because you don't have Python installed or don't want to
    install it?) modify vite.config.ts so that /api is proxied from
        https://clubradar.endfindme.com
    instead.

    Option 2:  Reverse proxy both frontend and backend from
    a separate WSGI.

    You need to install Werkzurg for this.  Go ahead and install the
    development dependencies.

        poetry install --with devel

    You'll need to 

        In one terminal:         |          In another terminal:
     ----------------------------+-----------------------------------------
        pnpm run dev             |          poetry run bin/httpd

    Now the site should be accessible at <http://localhost:8000/>.
