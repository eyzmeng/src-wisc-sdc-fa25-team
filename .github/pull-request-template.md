- [ ] I have checked that my name and e-mail address are consistently reflected in all commits.
- [ ] I have reviewed that all GPG signatures are valid and match my GitHub identity (possibly vacuously so).

# Cover letter

<!--
  Explain the changes however you want, to whatever extent you
  feel like elaborating, as long as your time and patience permit.
  If you would like a quality example, study how the Git project itself
  does it: https://git-scm.com/docs/MyFirstContribution#cover-letter

  You are not expected to write anything more than a cover letter, but
  a diffstat is welcome (see Pull Request #1 which I am about to make.)

  In the case of one commit, you may copy the commit body.
  In the case of more than a handful of commits, please summarize.
  (In this respect, Pull Request #1 is a bad example; but that is an
   exception I am making because it doubles as a communication email. ;)
