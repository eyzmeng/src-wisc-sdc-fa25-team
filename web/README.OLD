# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Tailwind CSS

Holy crap this is confusing as hell

TAILWIND IS NOW v4????

* <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#using-vite>
* <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/sveltekit>

```
$ pnpm add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
$ pnpm list tailwindcss
devDependencies:
tailwindcss 4.1.17
```

and there is no `npx tailwindcss init`.... sadge :<

To use it with Vite I need this guy apparently...

```
$ pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/vite
$ pnpm list @tailwindcss/vite
devDependencies:
@tailwindcss/vite 4.1.17
```
